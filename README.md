# MusicDB-BackEnd_Palvelinohjelmointi
This music database is my final assignment for the server programming course

In my back-end you can scroll throught songs and albums added to the database. You can also add, edit and delete songs & albums from the database.
The whole site is also password protected (with a very safe password i might add xdd).
